We are designing a platform where every individual can come, and write their daily journal about what they feel? Their goals for the day, what are the things they are grateful for? daily logs, etc. In the input journal, we'll be applying sentiment analysis and predict, how was their day? Was it happyðŸ˜„ or sadðŸ˜” and calculate the happiness score. Based on their happiness score, we'll be allocating them coins. If they have a high happiness score, they'll get more coins
